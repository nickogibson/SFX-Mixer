# Sound Effects Creator
A simple  web tool for generating and customizing sound effects directly in your browser. Built with Tone.js, this mixer allows you to tweak presets, edit the underlying code, and save your creations as .wav files, making it a perfect companion for indie game developers, especially for projects in engines like Unity.

# How to Use:
Select a Preset: Choose a base sound from the dropdown menu.
Adjust Parameters: Use the sliders to modify the volume, pitch, distortion, and reverb.
Edit the Code: For advanced customization, you can directly edit the generated JavaScript code in the text area.

Todo: A stop button that doesn't refresh the canvas.
But can still stop the looping sounds like Alien Drone?
